Demo of the LUIS Cognitive Services available through Azure Portal


The Language Understanding service enables you to define an app that encapsulates a language model that applications can use to interpret natural language input from users, predict the users intent (what they want to achieve), and identify any entities to which the intent should be applied.

For example, a language understanding app for a clock application might be expected to process input such as:

What is the time in London?

This kind of input is an example of an utterance (something a user might say or type), for which the desired intent is to get the time in a specific location (an entity); in this case, London.

You can use the Language Understanding SDK or REST API in code scripts to create and train the app, a simpler way is to use the portal to create the app, and export it as a .lu file that can be imported and retrained in another Language Understanding instance. This approach enables you to make use of the productivity benefits of the portal while maintaining portability and reproducibility for the app.
